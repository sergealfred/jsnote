# jsnote
This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

Click any text cell (including this one) to edit it
The code in each editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!
You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the show function. This is a function build into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values
Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right
Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell
All of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran npx jsnote-serge serve test.js, all of the text and code you write will be saved to the test.js file
